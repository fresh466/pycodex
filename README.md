PyCodex is a project where we generate code and programs with [AI](chat.openai.com).

## What is it for?
PyCodex tests the AI on many prompts and sees where the AI can go. So far it has been able to make:
* Game clones;
* A password generator with UI;
* A notepad from Tkinter; and
* [A 2D Space Invaders-like PacMan shooter](https://lolingvo.itch.io/pacman-has-a-gun).

It has also been able to make strictly math-related scripts such as:
* One that can make and render [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle) based on an input number of rows;
* Another that calculates how many digits it takes to hit every digit possible (1 to n) until it loops based on an input fraction; and
* One that uses the [Miller-Rabin test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerâ€“Rabin_primality_test) to tell if an input integer is prime.

## What is it testing?
PyCodex tests only for what works and what doesn't. If it tested for quality, half of all scripts here wouldn't be out right now.
